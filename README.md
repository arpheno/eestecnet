## Motivation

The motivation for creating this open source project is to provide an online platform for the
Electrical Engineering Students' European Association (EESTEC). Its purpose is to serve
as a central communication and administration hub for the association and preserve knowledge for
future generations.

## Use cases

The online platform of EESTEC will serve content to different visitors with different backgrounds and different intentions.
Visitors can be grouped according to the illustration below
![Different groups of visitors](use_cases.png "Use cases")

The platform should identify the key target groups and adapt its presentation to minimize the fraction of key users
leaving the website (red arrows) without having become associated with EESTEC.

### Implementation

This particular implementation identifies three key groups:

* Persons who have previously never heard of EESTEC
* Persons who have some interest in EESTEC
* Persons who are associated with the association.

In particular this implementation does not strive to be any of the following:

* A recruitment portal for Commitments
* A place to reaffirm company and university representatives

## General Description of the System

The system is implemented as a dynamic web service, or in laymen's terms a website. It
can be reached via a HTTP request and returns meaningful data in a HTTP response. The
content of the HTTP response depends on what was requested, and can be html files, stylesheets,
scripts or binary files like images.
